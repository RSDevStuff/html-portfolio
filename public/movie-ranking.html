<h1>My Top Movies for a Marathon Watch</h1>
<h2>You only need three movies, ever.</h2>

<h3>Ocean's 11</h3>
<p>Obviously the original is the best. This movie exudes charm, wit, and has an excellent soundtrack to go along with it's amazing plot.</p>

<h3>Ocean's 12</h3>
<p>This time France is involved. The subplot with Rusty's girlfriend is cute and all, but felt off. Still a great watch.</p>

<h3>Ocean's 13</h3>
<p>A great conclusion to the series. Linus gets his wings, the stakes are raised even higher, and there's plenty of obstacles to overcome.</p>
